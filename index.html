        <p >Web developers are professionals who build attractive and functional websites. <br> A professional and user-friendly website reflects a business that is <br>trustworthy, relevant and client or consumer-centric. <br> People make decisions about which products and services <br>to buy based on information they’ve searched for online.
    
    There are many templates available to set up your own website,<br> but it’s not foolproof. Unfortunately, a confusing or <br>sloppily designed website negatively impacts your professional image and equates to losing out on business. <br>
    
    Web development is broad and includes a variety of aspects of <br> building web applications and data management tools, <br> to developing an ecommerce website. Web developers  <br> may specialize in one aspect, or be <br> a ‘full-stack’ developer and work on all of them.
    
    A full-stack developer is all you need for a standard sized website with good <br>functionality. If you’re looking to improve or update a particular <br>aspect of your website, a specialized developer can surpass expectations.
    
    Web developers will ensure that your business or personal <br>website works reliably and effortlessly. Furthermore, they can make your life easier by <br>creating a user-friendly content management system to control your content.</p>
